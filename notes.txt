Canvas: is a way to use open GL in yer browser.
    Canvas is it's own window and shouldn't be bigger than your browser window. Should (basically) be fixed to your page.
        Not so cheap.

    Offscreen - there is an offscreen canvas API, OR you can just draw one with a different context and hide it
        Seo: drawImage (the hiding method) will work better. (You can draw a canvas without adding it to the DOM.).
        Offscreen would be a bit cleaner code because then you're not having to deal with those two render methods.
    NEXT STEP: figure out how to get your canvas to draw to another canvas, and render only part

TODO NEXT 2/17
    conditional render per dirty...
        incorporate with scroll feature...
    window.onresize
    set gemBox dimensions to onscreen dimensions on mount/resize
    ask Seo:
        where should all the logic go?
            ("can you extract the mouseDrag logic to a helper or something?")
            access store in actions/reducers for compares?
        check buffers in render?
        wait where to I put that offscreenDirty true?

    octavePx to go?
        removed from use, leaving old code on App for reference

    LINES PianoRoll var
        note you can add a prevCents (as well as nextCents) to help calc click placement

    HMMM, use of offsetwidth in componentDidMount
    const { cellwidth, cellCountX } = this.state
      // aren't those on redux now?

CANVAS RENDER QUESTIONS

    Seo:
     - window size or scroll/zoom dirties onScreen
     - window.onResize (or whatever) put that in componentDidMount (of PianoRoll or anything where it needs to know.)
        - (eafaa7: open console and then scroll/resize on Microtonal reference - it clips like 60% to re-size and the right 40% doesn't
    - set flags to true when you make 'em dirty
    Example:
        drawOnScreen() {
            if (this.state.offscreenBufferDirty) {
                drawOffScreen()
                & set it to clean
            }
            if (!this.state.onscreenBufferDirty) { return }
            & then do all the code... drawImage(parms, parms, parms...
        }
        render() {
            this.drawOnScreen()
        }


PLAYBACK
    noteHead
    u need the 'follow' option (scroll playHead vs scroll composition)


Heroku: first link IDs our app to Heroku (the website we go to). Second is the deployment target.
    https://protected-coast-63863.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/protected-coast-63863.git
did: git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/protected-coast-63863.git
did: git push heroku master
    that deploys it!
    heroku open (to open it in browser)

error message? do: heroku logs

ALSO did: git remote add origin git@github.com:gntsketches/tone-gems-server.git
     and: git push origin master
     DIDN'T do: git push -u origin master
        should check on how tracking branches interact with multiple remotes first...
