Canvas: is a way to use open GL in yer browser.
    Canvas is it's own window and shouldn't be bigger than your browser window. Should (basically) be fixed to your page.
        Not so cheap.

    Offscreen - there is an offscreen canvas API, OR you can just draw one with a different context and hide it
        Seo: drawImage (the hiding method) will work better. (You can draw a canvas without adding it to the DOM.).
        Offscreen would be a bit cleaner code because then you're not having to deal with those two render methods.
    NEXT STEP: figure out how to get your canvas to draw to another canvas, and render only part

TODO NEXT 2/17
    centsAndPxHeights to go?
    octavePx to go?
    conditional render per dirty...
        incorporate with scroll feature...
    const { cellwidth, cellCountX } = this.state
      // aren't those on redux now?
    ? (how) Are you still going to be using 'octavePx'
        betcha just as a constant. probs octavePx for onscreen will be offscreenOctavePx * zoomY
    Did state fields: zoomX, zoomY, scrollX, scrollY
    - TRY the alternate render option..
    - build top and side scrolls
        - scroll 'em and resize
    - add/remove notes by click
    - what's coming from redux? vs constants?

CANVAS RENDER QUESTIONS
    - x & y scroll zones as separate canvas or render to just one offscreen?
    - pitches/notes: render to offscreen? layer as separate canvas?

    Seo:
     - window size or scroll/zoom dirties onScreen
     - window.onResize (or whatever) put that in componentDidMount (of PinaoRoll or anything where it needs to know.)
        - (eafaa7: open console and then scroll/resize on Microtonal reference - it clips like 60% to re-size and the right 40% doesn't
    - set flags to true when you make 'em dirty
    Example:
        drawOnScreen() {
            if (this.state.offscreenBufferDirty) {
                drawOffScreen()
                & set it to clean
            }
            if (!this.state.onscreenBufferDirty) { return }
            & then do all the code... drawImage(parms, parms, parms...
        }
        render() {
            this.drawOnScreen()
        }


PLAYBACK
    noteHead
    u need the 'follow' option (scroll playHead vs scroll composition)


Heroku: first link IDs our app to Heroku (the website we go to). Second is the deployment target.
    https://protected-coast-63863.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/protected-coast-63863.git
did: git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/protected-coast-63863.git
did: git push heroku master
    that deploys it!
    heroku open (to open it in browser)

error message? do: heroku logs

ALSO did: git remote add origin git@github.com:gntsketches/tone-gems-server.git
     and: git push origin master
     DIDN'T do: git push -u origin master
        should check on how tracking branches interact with multiple remotes first...
