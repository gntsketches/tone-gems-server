        note names and time ticks on grid
        for PERFORMACE reasons, bet you'll have to stop printing such a HUGE CANVAS and only print the 'visible' part.

    function to manage drawNote data from props
        well... for now manage pitch, start, duration, velocity

REFACTORING
    Look out: newOctavePx*7 is in a bunch of places...

    login
        fetchAction axios call
            - what happens if offline?
        note that you want to let people compose even if not logged in (login for saving)
            FOR NOW just follow his example and use a landing page, and redirect to compose on login. see his logic on 73.
        btw
            non-rendering of login button when offline. should ideally say
            how would you bypass / fake login if offline?

DON'T DRAW A HUGE CANVAS. JUST RENDER THE VISIBLE PARTS.
    store as percentages visibleXLeft/Right and visibleYTop/Bottom
    probably in App...
    so how do you translate those percentages to the pitchMap?
    you gotta treat it as if the canvas did extend above and below
        each pitch has a variable 'height'
        at 100% zoom-out each pitch is (canvasHeight / octaves) * (cents/1200)
            maybe think:
                zoomYScale (what multiplier for zoom in?)
                & topDisplace
        what is the 'invisible' canvas height?
            (let's say the canvas is in the middle 50%, invisibleHeight is canvasHeight * 2)
        displayPercent = 100 - (top-bottom)
        ratio: canvasHeight/displayPercent = x/100
        invisibleHeight = 100 * (canvasHeight/displayPercent)
        visibleYTopPx = invisibleHeight * (visibleYTop / 100)
        visibleYBottomPx = invisibleHeight * (visibleYBottom / 100)
        THEN you say, what would the scale be for the whole vertical roll to take up that whole space
        so the height of each pitch is (invisibleHeight / octaves) * (cents/1200)
        so for each cell:
            check if the cellTopY is >= visibleTopYPx
            if so find that cell's height:

Later:
    label WesternReference with C, C#, etc.
    Coordinate Western against Microtonal (maybe when you add open/close feature.)
